# Additional Ropes
These ropes are present in NASSP but are not used in any of the supplied scenarios. They are included to either do system checks or to experiment with unflown ropes that still include some unique feature.
Reference the table below for details on each rope.

| Rope                 | Notes     |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Aurora12             | LGC testing software with full suite of self test programs. |
| BurstHR120           | Modified Sunburst120 rope with fixed HOLDRATE routine, that was intentionally broken in the flown Apollo 5 software. |
| Comanche055NBY6      | Modified Comanche 55 version for the Nearest Besselian Year 1969 coordinate system. Was used in NASSP for Apollo 10 CMC, but no longer required. |
| LMY99R0              | Luminary 99 revision 0, preceeding the flown Apollo 11 LM software. |
| Luminary069          | Initial release of the Apollo 10 LM software. Got an update to its lunar gravity model, Luminary 69 revision 2 was then flown on Apollo 10. Previously used in NASSP. |
| Luminary099_THROTLAG | Apollo 11 endured fairly severe throttle oscillations during the final descent to the Moon in P66, caused by a faulty value for the throttle lag. In this rope the false value for the lag is fully compensated (0.3 seconds instead of 0.2) leading to even worse oscillations. |
| Luminary130          | Original release of the Apollo 13 LM software. Flown was Luminary 131/1. |
| Sunburst37           | Early revision of the Apollo 5 LM software. Flown was Sunburst 120. |
| SundialE             | CMC checkout software. |
| Zerlina56            |  Don Eyles' off-branch AGC program, containing many features that made it into Luminary 1E and others that were never flown. |
