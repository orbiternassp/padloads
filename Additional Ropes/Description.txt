Aurora12: LGC testing software with full suite of self test programs
BurstHR120: Modified Sunburst120 rope with fixed HOLDRATE routine, that was intentionally broken in the flown Apollo 5 software
Comanche055NBY69: Modified Comanche 55 version for the Nearest Besselian Year 1969 coordinate system. Was used in NASSP for Apollo 10 CMC, but no longer required
LMY99R0: Luminary 99 revision 0, preceeding the flown Apollo 11 LM software
Luminary069: Initial release of the Apollo 10 LM software. Got an update to its lunar gravity model, Luminary 69 revision 2 was then flown on Apollo 10. Previously used in NASSP.
Luminary099_THROTLAG: Apollo 11 endured fairly severe throttle oscillations during the final descent to the Moon in P66, caused by a faulty value for the throttle lag. In this rope the false value for the lag is fully compensated (0.3 seconds instead of 0.2) leading to even worse oscillations.
Luminary130: Original release of the Apollo 13 LM software. Flown was Luminary 131/1.
Sunburst37: Early revision of the Apollo 5 LM software. Flown was Sunburst 120.
SundialE: CMC checkout software.
